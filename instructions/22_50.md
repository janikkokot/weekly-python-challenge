Protein Synthesis: From DNA to Polypeptide
==========================================

Our cells go through a process called protein synthesis to translate the instructions in DNA into an amino acid chain, or polypeptide.

Your job is to replicate this!

Step 1: Transcription
---------------------

Your input will be a string of DNA that looks like this:

`'TACAGCTCGCTATGAATC'`

You then must transcribe it to mRNA. Each letter, or base, gets transcribed.
```
A -> U
G -> C
C -> G
T -> A
```

Also, you will split it into groups of three, or _codons_.

The above example would become:

`'AUG UCG AGC GAU ACU UAG'`


Step 2: Translation
-------------------

After you have the mRNA strand, you will turn it into an amino acid chain.

Each codon corresponds to an amino acid:

|AA  | mRNA                            | 
|:---|:--------------------------------|
|Ala | GCU, GCC, GCA, GCG              | 
|Leu | UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, CUG    |  
|Arg | CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, AGG    |  
|Lys | AAA, AAG                        |   
|Asn | AAU, AAC                        |  
|Met | AUG                             |
|Asp | GAU, GAC                        | 
|Phe | UUU, UUC                        | 
|Cys | UGU, UGC                        | 
|Pro | CCU, CCC, CCA, CCG              |
|Gln | CAA, CAG                        |
|Ser | UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG, AGU, AGC    |
|Glu | GAA, GAG                        |
|Thr | ACU, ACC, ACA, ACG              |
|Gly | GGU, GGC, GGA, GGG              |
|Trp | UGG                             |
|His | CAU, CAC                        |
|Tyr | UAU, UAC                        |
|Ile | AUU, AUC, AUA                   |
|Val | GUU, GUC, GUA, GUG              |
|Stop|  UAG, UGA, UAA                  |             

The above example would become:
`'Met Ser Ser Thr Asp Stop'`

Any additional sets of bases that aren't in a group of three aren't included.
Your final output will be the mRNA sequence and the polypeptide.

Here are some examples:
```python
>>> solution('TACAGCTCGCTATGAATC')
['AUG UCG AGC GAU ACU UAG', 'Met Ser Ser Asp Thr Stop']

>>> solution('ACGTG')
['UGC AC', 'Cys']
```
